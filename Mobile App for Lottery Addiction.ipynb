    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Created four main functions for the app:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `one_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket\n",
    "* `check_historical_occurrence()` — checks whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery data set\n",
    "* `multi_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability for any number of of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816\n",
    "* `probability_less_6()` — calculates the probability of having two, three, four or five winning numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible features for a second version of the app include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Making the outputs even easier to understand by adding fun analogies (for example, we can find probabilities for strange events and compare with the chances of winning in lottery; for instance, we can output something along the lines \"You are 100 times more likely to be the victim of a shark attack than winning the lottery\").\n",
    "* Combining the `one_ticket_probability()` and `check_historical_occurrence()` to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time.\n",
    "* Creating a function similar to `probability_less_6()` which calculates the probability of having at least two, three, four or five winning numbers."
